Rather than having each student install the software in their own directories, follow this guide to install software in one central location, then share that software with everyone in the course using modulefiles. Choose the Right Install Location Software should be installed in your work directory. Navigate to your work space and make a new folder for software: $ cd $STOCKYARD $ mkdir class-software/ $ cd class-software/ $ pwd /work/01234/username/class-software/ Please note: your work directory will be a slightly different path - please substitute in the path of your work directory when following the guide below. Download and Install Software The installation process differs for each software package, and a comprehensive guide for installing software will not be included here. Please check the user guides for whichever machine you are installing on for general installation help. It is good practice to organize installed software by package name and version. This will also help later when building modulefiles. As an example, this guide will show the process to install a tool called bedtools2 , a toolset for genome arithmetic, on Lonestar6: # Load a recent gcc module, required for bedtools2 $ module load gcc # Download and unpack the tool $ wget https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2/archive/refs/tags/v2.29.2.tar.gz $ tar -xvzf v2.29.2.tar.gz $ cd bedtools2-2.29.2/ # Compile the software $ make # Copy the binaries into a standard location $ DESTDIR=\"/work/01234/username/class-software/\" prefix=\"bedtools2/2.29.2\" make install The steps above will put the binaries in the folder: /work/01234/username/class-software/bedtools2/2.29.2/bin Please remember, these steps will vary from package to package and will likely only work as described for this specific package.

Additionally, students may have assignments, projects, or exams that need to be shared privately with the instructor. Follow this guide to create public, shared classroom workspaces as well as private, individual student directories. Create a Shared Directory for the Classroom This shared directory will serve as a project workspace for the classroom and is only accessible to users in the same allocation. Recall that all users on one project will share the allocations of that project and belong to the same UNIX \"group\". As members of the same UNIX group, users will typically share the same permissions (read, write, execute, etc.) on a set of files or directories. The UNIX group number (ex. G-876543 ) will usually correspond to the project/allocation number and can be found in the Portal by selecting Projects & Allocations then Active Projects . Shared directories and files should be on the work file system. A good place to do this is at the root of your work directory - called $STOCKYARD . To access the filesystem, log in to the HPC cluster for your allocation. Please check the user guides for instructions on logging in to TACC machines. To create a shared directory, follow the commands below. # Make your STOCKYARD directory accessible to users in your group. $ chmod g+X $STOCKYARD # Navigate to that directory and create a class directory to be shared. $ cd $STOCKYARD; mkdir class-directory # Your shared class directory will need to belong to the UNIX group that # matches your project allocation. For example, if the group is `G-876543`: $ chgrp -R G-876543 class-directory # Set your group ID so that new files created in the shared class directory # will inherit the group ownership. $ chmod g+s class-directory # Set permissions so that the project workspace is readable and accessible # to group members. $ chmod g+rX class-directory # Lastly, take note of the path to your directory. Students will be able # to access files in the shared directory through this path. $ cd class-directory $ pwd /work/01234/username/class-directory/ Copy a File from the Shared Directory To copy a file located in the shared class directory, log in to a system of your choice and enter the following commands: # Copy the file into your work file system $ cd $WORK $ cp /work/01234/username/class-directory/file1 . Create Student Directories for Turning in Assignments Individual student directories with permissions specific to that student will protect students' homework from being seen by other users in the same allocation. We encourage you to create a subdirectory in the class-directory we made earlier to contain all of the student folders. To create the individual student directories, we have provided a script below.

G-876543 ) will usually correspond to the project/allocation number and can be found in the Portal by selecting Projects & Allocations then Active Projects . Shared directories and files should be on the work file system. A good place to do this is at the root of your work directory - called $STOCKYARD . To access the filesystem, log in to the HPC cluster for your allocation. Please check the user guides for instructions on logging in to TACC machines. To create a shared directory, follow the commands below. # Make your STOCKYARD directory accessible to users in your group. $ chmod g+X $STOCKYARD # Navigate to that directory and create a class directory to be shared. $ cd $STOCKYARD; mkdir class-directory # Your shared class directory will need to belong to the UNIX group that # matches your project allocation.

These are shared resources and users should not run applications here (including Python, Matlab, R, or any other code downloaded from the internet). Instead, these applications should be run on a compute node . Determine if You Are on a Login or Compute Node To determine what type of node you are logged into, use the command hostname . The output of hostname will either show a login node (e.g. login1 , login2 ), or it will show a series of letters and numbers (e.g. nid00015 , c001-005 ) indicating a compute node. The exact output will vary from cluster to cluster. By default, the same information is located at the beginning of the command prompt, as is seen in the next section. Connect to a Compute Node To launch an interactive session on a compute node, use the idev command.

Cyberduck is a free graphical tool for data transfer and an alternative to using the command line. With a drag-and-drop interface, it is easy to transfer a file from the UTRC Portal to your local system. You can use Cyberduck for Windows or macOS. Windows Cyberduck Download and install Cyberduck for Windows on your local machine. Click Open Connection in the top left corner of your Cyberduck window. To setup a connection, select SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) from the drop-down menu and type in the server name data.tacc.utexas.edu . Add your TACC username and password in the spaces provided. If the More Options area is not shown, click the small triangle button to expand the window; this will allow you to enter the path to your UTRC project directory (ex. /corral-repl/tacc/aci/UTRC/projects/UTRC-ProjectIDNumber ) so that when Cyberduck opens the connection you will immediately be in the UTRC project folder on Corral. Remember to replace ProjectIDNumber with the correct number of the project folder you wish to connect to. Click the Connect button to open your connection. To Identify Project ID Numbers: Instructors & Students: If you are the PI of the project folder, you can find the Project ID Number by navigating to the My Projects section of the UTRC Portal. The unique Project ID Number of each project is listed under Project Id in the second column. Otherwise, you will have to contact the PI of the project folder you wish to connect to via Cyberduck to receive the Project ID Number. Note: The PI of the project folder you wish to connect to via Cyberduck will provide you with the Project ID Number to be used in the path. For example, if your PI has a project called Example Project with a corresponding Project ID Number of 26, the path to Example Project would be /corral-repl/tacc/aci/UTRC/projects/UTRC-26 .
