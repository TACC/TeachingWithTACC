# Request a Queue Reservation

TACC clusters consistently operate at very high node occupancy, meaning compute
nodes are not necessarily instantly available for interactive sessions or batch
jobs. However, PIs may request a queue reservation for a specific date, time,
duration, and number of nodes.

## Submit a Request

To make a reservation request, [please submit a ticket here](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-consulting).
Include the following information in the request:

* TACC cluster name
* Start date / time
* End date / time
* Number of nodes in the reservation
* List of usernames who should have access

Your instructional allocation will be billed for the entire duration of the
reservation. For example, if you reserve 30 nodes for 3 hours, your allocation
will be charged (30 x 3) 90 SUs whether or not they are all actively used for
the entire reservation. Please submit requests at least two weeks before the
desired start date.

## Use a Reservation

For an interactive session, use the following flag:

```
[login]$ idev -r reservation_name
```

For a batch job, use the following flag:

```
[login]$ sbatch --reservation=reservation_name myjobscript.slurm
```
