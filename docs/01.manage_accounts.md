# Manage Student Access

Managing student access to your educational allocation can be done through the [TACC Accounts Management Portal](https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/project_invite).

## Adding Students to Projects

Once your allocation has been approved navigate to the link above and follow these steps:

1.  Select your project from a drop down box, 
2.  Enter a list of email addresses (e.g. all the students) into the form,
3.  Click the ‘create new invitations’ button.

From here, the website will send instructions to each student whose email was entered on how to create a TACC account.
Once they have created an account, it will automatically add them to the selected project.

Students who already have TACC accounts associated with the emails entered in will automatically be added to the selected project.

## Managing Invites

You can check the status of invites using the "Manage Outstanding Invites" button at the bottom of the page. 
This will allow you to see the list of emails who have been invited to your selected project, see who has created
a TACC account and been added to the project, and send reminder emails to those who have not yet accepted the 
invitation.
