# Manage Student Accounts

To be added to a project, students must have already created a TACC account. If your students need to create a TACC account, they can follow our guide below.

## Creating a Student Account
Students are encouraged to create an account with their institution provided email address. An institution email address is one that your college or university has issued to you upon matriculation and will end with a .edu address.

To create a TACC account, redirect your browser to the [TACC User Portal](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu).

Click the **Create a TACC Account** button. Review the **Request a TACC Portal Account** page and click **Continue to Create an Account**. Accept the **TACC Acceptable Use Policy**. Enter your contact information and account information in the request form. You will see a field about PI eligibility. Students are ineligible to be a PI. Please select that you are *not* PI Eligible.

Once your account is requested, you will receive a confirmation email within one business day with a link to verify your address. After verifying your email address, logon to the [TACC User Portal](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu). For your first login, you will be prompted to review and agree to the **Terms of Use**.

TACC now requires Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). To set up MFA, you can follow [this tutorial](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/tutorials/multifactor-authentication).

## Adding Students to an Instructional Allocation
Students can be added to your instructional allocation through the [TACC User Portal](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu). Sign in then hover over the **Allocations** tab in your dashboard and select **Projects and Allocations**.

Select **View Project Detail** of the project you wish to add students to. In the **Users** section, select **Add User**. Search for student TACC accounts by **Last Name**, **Email Address**, or **TACC Username**. Find the student account you wish to add in the search results and select **Add Selected User**.

Note that all users on one project will share the allocations of that project and belong to the same UNIX "group". As members of the same UNIX "group", users will typically share the same permissions (read, write, execute, etc.) on a set of files or directories. The UNIX "group" number will usually correspond to the project/allocation number and can be found by selecting **View Project Detail** of a project of your choice on the **Projects and Allocations** page.  

## Removing Students from an Instructional Allocation
An instructional allocation will last for the duration of the class plus 14 days. At anytime during the instructional allocation period you can remove a student manually.

Sign in to the [TACC User Portal](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu). Hover over the **Allocations** tab in your dashboard and select **Projects and Allocations**. Select **View Project Detail** of the project you wish to remove students from. In the **Users** section, select **Remove User** to remove a student account from your project.
