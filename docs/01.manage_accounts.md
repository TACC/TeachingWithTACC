# Manage Student Accounts

Managing student accounts on your projects can now be done using the [TACC Accounts](https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/) website.

## Adding Students to Projects

Professors are able to manage access to projects for their students from the Accounts.tacc website. 
In order to do so, please follow these instructions:

1.  Select a project from a drop down box, 
2.  Enter a list of email addresses (e.g. all the students) into the form  
3.  Click the ‘create new invitations’ button.

From here, the website will send instructions to each student whose email was entered on how to create a TACC account.
Once they have created an account, it will automatically add them to the selected project.

Students who already have TACC accounts associated with the emails entered in will automatically be added to the selected project.

## Managing Invites to Projects

There is a option to manage the invites that have been sent out using the "Manage Outstanding Invites" button from the Accounts.tacc website. 
Using this will allow you to check the list of emails who have been invited to your selected project. 

Accounts that have not yet made a TACC account will be shown.
There will be a button here to send reminders to the emails to create a TACC account.
