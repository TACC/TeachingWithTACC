# Additional Features of the UTRC Portal

## Applications
The Applications section of the UTRC Portal allows you to select and launch applications or workflows on TACC's HPC (High Performance Computing) resources, using data from storage systems found in the Data Files section.

Applications allows users to perform simulations and analyze data using popular simulation codes, as well as data analysis and visualization tools including Jupyter, MATLAB, and QGIS. Users can also publish their own private applications and manage them under the My Apps tab in the toolbar. To learn more, contact *acantu@tacc.utexas.edu*.

> Note: It is the Project PI's responsibility to provide resources or links to documentation about portal-specific applications for their users and guidance on how to use the project's allocated resources properly on the HPC resources.

Additional applications can be added to the portal as requested by the project. These apps have to be vetted for compatibility with TACC resources, tested, then published into the Agave ecosystem before they can be exposed in the portal UI. The TACC portals team can assist users in identifying and validating apps for use in the portal based on their requirements. To request a custom portal app, [please submit a ticket here](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-consulting).
