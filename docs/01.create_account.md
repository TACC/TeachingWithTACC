# Create a TACC Account

To create a TACC account, visit the [TACC Account Management Portal](https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/register).

We recommend using your institutional email address (ending in '.edu') for account creation, as it accelerates the approval process. Every instructor and student needs to make their own TACC account, and cannot share account credentials.

In order to log into the HPC clusters, TACC requires Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Instructions to set up MFA are [here](https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/basics/mfa/).
