# Create a TACC Account

To create a TACC account, redirect your browser to the [TACC User Portal](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu).

Click the **Create a TACC Account** button. Review the **Request a TACC Portal Account** page and click **Continue to Create an Account**. Accept the **TACC Acceptable Use Policy**. Enter your contact information and account information in the request form. Select your PI eligibility at this time. To know if you are PI Eligible, please review our [eligibility requirements](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/allocations-overview).

Once your account is requested, you will receive a confirmation email within one business day with a link to verify your address. After verifying your email address, logon to the [TACC User Portal](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu). For your first login, you will be prompted to review and agree to the **Terms of Use**.

TACC now requires Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). To set up MFA, you can follow [this tutorial](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/tutorials/multifactor-authentication).
