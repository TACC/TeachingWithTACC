# Request an Allocation

Access to the various resources is gained by requesting an "Educational Allocation" to work
on that system. Only eligible Faculty or Instructional Staff can request educational 
allocations to support academic classes.


Instructions for requesting an allocation are different depending on the identity of 
your institution and which resource you are requesting. All instructions can be found
by visiting the [Allocations page](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/use-tacc/allocations/)
