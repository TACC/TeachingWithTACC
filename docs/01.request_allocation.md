# Request an Allocation

Access to the various resources is gained by requesting an "Educational Allocation" to work
on that system. Only eligible Faculty or Instructional Staff can request educational 
allocations to support academic classes.


Instructions for requesting an allocation are different depending on the identity of 
your institution and which resource you are requesting. All instructions can be found
by visiting the [Allocations page](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/use-tacc/allocations/)

# Types of Allocations
The different types of Allocations that can be requested are:

## Startup 
Startup projects are meant to provide the PI with an adequate allocation to benchmark and test to build a case for a Research or Educational project. Startup projects will typically receive small allocations with short durations. 

PIs can apply for a Startup project allocation at any time.

## Educational
Educational project allocations support academic classes, with limited allocation sizes and only on certain TACC resources.

Educational project allocations will last for the duration of the class plus 14 days.

## Research
Research project allocations support the computational needs of the scientific community. Research project allocations begin on calendar quarters, are normally for one year, and must be renewed annually for multi-year projects. Requests for new research allocations and renewals must be submitted 30 days prior to the start of the allocation period. Requests submitted after the due date will be considered for the next allocation period. PIs can apply for startup project allocations until the next research project quarterly deadline.

Research allocation requests are reviewed four times per year according to the a schedule of deadlines that may be found on the [Allocations page](https://tacc.utexas.edu/use-tacc/allocations/).
