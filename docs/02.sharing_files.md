As an instructor, you may have code, data, or other project files that need to be shared publicly with your classroom. Additionally, students may have assignments, projects, and exams that need to be shared privately with the instructor. Follow this guide to create public, shared classroom workspaces as well as private, individual student directories.

<br>

#### Create a Shared Directory for the Classroom
This shared directory will serve as a project workspace for the classroom and is only accessible to users in the same allocation. Recall that all users on one project will share the allocations of that project and belong to the same UNIX "group". As members of the same UNIX group, users will typically share the same permissions (read, write, execute, etc.) on a set of files or directories. The UNIX group number (ex. `G-876543`) will usually correspond to the project/allocation number and can be found in the [Portal](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/projects-and-allocations) by selecting **View Project Detail** of a project of your choice on the **Projects and Allocations** page.

<br>

Shared directories and files should be in your work directory on Stockyard. On a system of your choice, make your `$STOCKYARD` directory accessible to users in your group.

```
$ chmod g+X $STOCKYARD
```

Navigate to your work directory on Stockyard and create a class directory to be shared.

```
$ cd $STOCKYARD; mkdir class-directory
```

Your shared class directory will need to belong to the UNIX group that matches with your project allocation. To do so, set the UNIX group using the command below. For example, if the UNIX group is `G-876543`:   

```
$ chgrp -R G-876543 class-directory
```

Set your group ID so that new files created in the shared class directory will inherit the group ownership.

```
$ chmod g+s class-directory
```

Set your permissions so that the project workspace is readable and accessible to group members.

```
$ chmod g+rX class-directory
```

Lastly, take note of the path to your directory. Students will be able to access files and documents in the shared directory through this path.

```
$ cd class-directory
$ pwd
/work/01234/username/class-directory/
```

<br>

##### Helper Script
Log in to your system of choice. A comprehensive guide for logging in to TACC systems will not be included here. Please check the [user guides](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides) for whichever machine you wish to log in to.

<br>

In your preferred text editor, copy and paste the code below and save as a shell script named *share_project.sh*.
```
#!/bin/bash

chmod g+X $STOCKYARD

cd $STOCKYARD

mkdir class-directory

chgrp -R G-876543 class-directory

chmod g+s class-directory

chmod g+rX class-directory

cd class-directory

echo $(pwd)
```
Execute the shell script by entering the following command:
```
$ ./share_project.sh
```
<br>

Upon execution of this script, you will see output in your terminal of the path to your new class directory. Please note the path of your directory, as students will be able to access files and documents in the shared directory through this path.
```
/work/01234/username/class-directory/
```
To copy the shared class directory, log in to a system of your choice and enter the following commands:
```
# Copy the directory into your work file system
$ cd $WORK
$ cp -r /work/01234/username/class-directory/ ./
```
To copy an assignment located in the shared class directory, log in to a system of your choice and enter the following commands:
```
# Copy the file into your work file system
$ cd $WORK
# Rename the file with your TACC username
$ cp /work/01234/username/class-directory/hw1 student_username_hw1
```

<br>

#### Create Student Directories for Handing in Assignments
Individual student directories with write-only permissions specific to that student will protect students' assignments from being seen by other users in the same allocation.

- Write-only
- Used for students to turn in homework
- Assignments folder, subfolder only accessible to one student in classroom
- Other students unable to see other students' folders
