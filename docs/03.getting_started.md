# Getting Started

## Create a UTRC Portal Account
A comprehensive guide to creating a UTRC Portal account is [available here](https://utrc.tacc.utexas.edu/get-started/).

Please follow the steps outlined in the **Logging in for the First Time** section of **[Getting Started](https://utrc.tacc.utexas.edu/get-started/)**.

> Note: In order to access the UTRC Portal, you will need to have an active TACC account. If you do not have one already, please follow section 1.1 **[Create a TACC Account](https://tacc.github.io/TeachingWithTACC/01.create_account/)** of our Teaching with TACC guide. You will also have to be on an active project allocation to access the UTRC Portal. Ask the Principal Investigator of your research project to add you to their project allocation through the [TACC User Portal](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu).

To finish onboarding, complete the **Getting An Allocation**, **Setting up Multi-factor Authentication**, and **Accessing Your Files** section(s) of **[Getting Started](https://utrc.tacc.utexas.edu/getting-started/)**.
